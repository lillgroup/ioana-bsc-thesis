"""SUPERSEDED (2026-10-26): this drops the crystal waters, which md-tools keeps; without them the
pocket is refilled with bulk water (3QL3 folate drifted out). New complexes:
runs/REST2-complex-xtalwater (scripts/add_crystal_waters.py adds the chain-A waters to this
script's output). Kept unchanged as the record of how the earlier complex runs were prepared.

Complex inputs for the five REST2-conformers ligands, from the deposited crystal structures.

  python -I scripts/prep.py <root>

For each entry: chain A protein (altloc ' '/'A', altloc column blanked) + the chain-A copy of the
ligand, written to <root>/<name>/prep/complex.pdb. Crystallisation additives (DMS, GOL, SO4, NO3),
the chain-B copies and crystal waters are dropped. The ligand stays heavy-atom only: md-tools puts
the WATER-RUN package's hydrogens on it (the package is reused unchanged, see packages/).
Every chain-A ligand was checked to sit in chain A's own pocket (4IBI/4IBK: one chain-B residue
within 4 A, a crystal contact).
